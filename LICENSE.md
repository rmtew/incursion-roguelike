This file exists to document all the licenses that are relevant to the Incursion

Remember that some of these are binary dependencies we bundle with our releases
and some may solely apply to those.

## GPL 2

The IncursionScript compiler is based on the GPL 2 licensed Accent runtime.
We do not include it in our releases which are Release builds, but we do
include it in Debug builds which we do not distribute. This is why we will
never distribute Debug builds with the resource compiler, anyone wanting
to develop their own game content and compile it can obtain the source
code and build their own Debug builds to do so.
