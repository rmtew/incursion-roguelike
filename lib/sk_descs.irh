    "The Animal Empathy skill represents a primal, empathic link with
    wild beasts, and has the following use:\n
    __<15>* <11>Influence Animals (Passive):<3> This skill allows you 
    to communicate with animals and magical beasts. You can pacify angry 
    animals, making them nonhostile. You can cow angry animals, making 
    them afraid of you. You can soothe allied animals, removing sleep 
    and fear. Finally, you can befriend nonhostile animals, turning them 
    into temporary party members. The DC for an Animal Empty skill check 
    is 15 + the challenge rating of the animal.";

Text "help::appraise"
  { "__The Appraise skill has the following Passive uses.
     All represent new information that shows up in the window
     when you examine a monster:\n
    __<15>* <11>Discern Hiding Awareness (Passive):<3> When you are Hiding
    in Shadows and you examine a creature, the game will tell you if that
    creature is aware or unaware of your presence if your [Appraise - 4]
    is equal to or higher than the subject's Bluff. Otherwise, you do not
    receive any indication.\n
    __<15>* <11>Identify Monsters (Passive):<3> The primary utility of Appraise
    is the ability to appraise monsters. By carefully observing other
    creatures and noting tell-tale signs in their behaviour, a character with
    a high Appraise skill can learn a great deal about intelligent creatures.
    Appraise is the primary skill that is used to identify the true nature
    of monsters who initially appear as other kinds of monsters -- a character
    might spot a vampire, dragon or wererat posing as a normal human, or discern
    that a kobold is in fact a skilled kobold rogue merely be watching the way
    she moves. Appraise is not the only skill that helps to identify monsters
    -- many Knowledge skills aid as well, and Appraise affects only intelligent
    creatures, but it is the only skill that allows a character to determine if a
    monster has class levels, or to tell a human priest apart from a human mage.\n
    __The check to identify a monster is made automatically the very first time
    the player character sees the monster. The DC of a check to identify a 
    creature's fundamental nature (telling a vampire apart from a normal human)
    is DC 10 + the subject's CR, whereas discerning a creature's class or level
    of skill is DC 15 + CR. This check is only ever made once; if it is successful,
    the game will tell the player that her character's knowledge aided in identifying
    the creature in question.\n 
    __<15>* <11>Sense Motivation (Passive, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> The Appraise skill can be used
    to determine what a creature desires, and how it feels about other creatures
    around it. Learning this information requires that the character possess a Sense
    Motive skill of 7, plus the subject's CR, plus 1 per 10 feet currently between 
    the subject and the PC; it's harder to discern motives at a great range, since 
    it involves observing body language. If the player character's Appraise level
    is sufficient, this information will automatically appear in the monster's
    description when it is examined.\n 
    __<15>* <11>Discern Strain (Passive, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> Strain represents the status of a
    follower's relationship with her leader. If a character has an Appraise
    skill of [10 + a subject's CR], she can see how much strain that creature's
    leader has accumulated toward it -- the higher a creature's strain, the more
    likely it is to snap and turn on its leader if something happens that should
    offend it.\n
    __<15>* <11>Psionic Combat (Passive, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> The Sense
    Motive skill is useful for discerning the psychological weaknesses of
    other characters, and thus plays a strong role in psionic combat. The
    threat range of a character's psionic attack modes increases by +1 for
    every full +5 Appraise a psychic character possesses.\n";

Text "help::athletics"
  {
    "The Athletics skill has the following effects:\n
      __<15>* <11>Increased Movement (Passive):<3> The Athletics skill increases a
      character's base movement rate. For every +2 worth of a character's
      overall Athletics rating, her movement rate increases by 5~.\n
      __<15>* <11>Increased Fatigue (Passive):<3> Athletic activity also improves
      endurance and general health. A character with this skill adds
      [Athletics / 3] to her maximum total Fatigue points.\n
      __<15>* <11>Train Attributes (Passive):<3> A character with a high Athletics
      skill maintains a regular program of calisthenics, dietary
      management, body training and so forth in order to improve her
      physical prowess. In game terms, this makes it easier for her
      to exercise her physical Attributes to gain inherent Attribute
      bonuses. A character that has the Athletics skill needs only
      [100 - Skill Rating] percentile points to successfully gain a
      +1 inherent bonus to Strength, Dexterity or Constitution rather
      than the full 100.";
      /*
      __<15>* <11>Recover Attributes (Passive):<3> Athletic characters are sometimes
      able to recover Attribute damage simply through exertion and forcing
      their body to work over the poison, negative energy or other ailment.
      Every 3d10 swings the character makes in combat gives her a chance to
      recover a point of physical Attribute damage, provided that her Athletics
      skill is higher than [5 + (5 x the total damage to the Attribute in
      question)].

Text "help::alchemy"
  {
    "The Alchemy skill has the following effects:\n
      __<15>* <11>Identify Potions (Passive):<3> Characters with exceptional 
      ratings in the Alchemy skill can identify potions. This requires a 
      check against a DC of 15 + twice the depth the potion is usually found 
      at, and is only made one per potion, ever.\n
      __<15>* <11>Create Alchemical Items (Active):<3> The primary purpose of the
      Alchemy skill is the manufacture of alchemical items. A character with
      the Alchemy skill and access to an alchemy kit can create a number of
      different items equal to their Alchemy skill rating, albiet with a cost
      in both experience and time.\n
      __<15>* <11>Potion Formulas (Passive):<3> A character with the Brew Potions 
      feat is able to create potions; the number of formulas for potions she knows
      is based on the average of her skill ratings in Alchemy and Knowledge
      (Magic). This total does not include any potions she may be able to
      manufacture as a result of knowing the spell the potion is based on.
      __<15>* <11>Identify Potions (Passive):<3> When your character drinks an 
      unknown potion, and the effect is not immediately obvious, an Alchemy check 
      is allowed against a DC of 10 + the potion's depth in order to identify the 
      effect that potions of that type contain.";

Text "help::balance"
  {
    "The Balance skill has the following effects:\n
      __<15>* <11>Resist Knockdown (Passive):<3> The balance skill 
      aids you in resisting knockdown and knockback in combat; you 
      gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to half your Balance 
      skill rating if you have Balance as a class skill.\n
      __<15>* <11>Tightrope Walking (Active):<3> Characters with a 
      rating of 10 or higher in the Balance skill are able to do 
      tightrope walking. Using the skill at the edge of a chasm or
      other dangerous terrain will create a rope walk-line from your
      current position to the nearest wall in the specified direction.
      Every square so affected consumes 10 feet of rope. You must
      thus have both sufficient rope and a crossbow (to use to fire
      the rope, like a grappel gun) to do this. Creating a tightrope
      bridge does not require a skill check, but you do have to have
      Balance 10+ to do it.\n
      __Moving while on a tightrope requires a Balance check (DC 15)
      for every square covered. If you suffer damage while on the
      tightrope, you must make a Balance check against DC 20 + 2 per
      5~ of your total hit points suffered. Failing either of these
      checks causes you to suffer the effects of the terrain you fall
      onto, to become prone and to be unable to use the tightrope bridge 
      again until you reach solid flooring.\n
      __<15>* <11>Terrain Effects (Passive):<3> Some types of terrain -- 
      notably ice -- require a Balance check to cross or fight on without 
      suffering some side effect, as described in the terrain in
      question.\n
      __<15>* <11>Invisibility to Tremorsense (Passive):<3> Characters 
      with a Balance score of 20+ are able to move so carefully and 
      softly as to be immune to Tremorsense whenever they are Hiding.
      At 30+, they are immune to Tremorsense at all times, whether they
      are hiding or not.\n
      __<15>* <11>Mounted Casting (Passive):<3> Casting while mounted
      normally takes a character 15 phases more than usual; characters
      with Balance 20+ are exempt from this restriction.\n
      __<15>* <11>Aeriel Casting (Passive):<3> Characters using magic
      to fly or levitate must succeed in a Balance check to correctly
      perform the somatic components of a spell. The DC of this check
      is 7 + (Spell Level x 3).";

Text "help::bluff"
  {
    "__The Bluff skill has these uses:\n
        <15>* <11>Exploitation (Talking):<3> Characters can use the Bluff 
      skill to exploit others, convincing them that damage inflicted 
      wasn't a hostile act and causing creatures who have become hostile 
      as the result of being attacked or suffering damage to become 
      neutral again. Thus, a character with high Bluff can convince
      summoned creatures to set off traps, use allies as cannon fodder,
      etc. and still manage to retain their loyalty. This can't be 
      used to change the attitude of creatures who begin play hostile 
      (use Diplomacy for that) -- it is only effective on creatures 
      who began friendly or neutral and became hostile as a result of 
      later events. The DC for this ability varies based on many 
      different circumstances. Exploitation is an evil act -- unless
      it is used on an inherently evil creature.\n
      __<15>* <11>Create Distraction (Active):<3> The Bluff skill can
      be used to create a distraction, misleading creatures observing
      the skill user. If this use is successful, creatures watching
      the skill user are not counted as witnesses for the purposes of
      Hiding -- the character can draw the attention of others away
      from her and slip into the shadows even when surrounded by foes.
      If the character beats a given observer's distraction DC by 10
      or more, that observer is so distracted that they are considered
      off-guard against the Bluff user's attacks for a full round, in
      addition to the normal effect.\n
      __Every previous distraction attempt against the same creature
      increases the DC of future attempts by +2 if successful, or +5 if
      it fails. A character can elect to try and distract everyone
      watching her at the same time, but this increases the DC by +5.
      The base DC of a distraction attempt is 10 + the target's Will
      save modifier or Concentration skill rating, whichever is
      superior -- for multiple targets, the highest DC from the group
      determines if a distraction is successful.\n
      __<15>*_<11>Conceal Alignment (Active):<3> Some creatures are hostile 
      to other creatures based on alignment, and in some cases alignment
      affects other skill checks, usually giving penalties; furthermore,
      characters with radically different alignments than a party leader's
      count as higher effective CR when they join a party. In all these
      cases, the creatures are assumed to be familiar with the player's
      alignment based on her reputation and past actions -- however, a
      character with Bluff as a class skill is assumed to be covert
      enough in her behaviour and activities that other creatures will
      not easily be able to perceive her alignment. Such a character
      suffers alignment-based penalties or hostility only if the subject
      creature's Appraise skill exceeds her Bluff skill. If it does
      not, creatures perceive her as whatever alignment favours her most
      -- devils will perceive her as Lawful Evil, for example, and thus
      be non-hostile to her and eager to deal.\n
      __<15>* <11>Trick Magic (Passive):<3> A rogue's special ability
      to use class or race-specific magic is based on the sum of her
      Bluff and Use Magic scores.\n
      __<15>* <11>Issue Requests (Talking):<3> Characters that lack a
      strong rating in the Diplomacy skill can choose to use their
      Bluff skill in place of Diplomacy to Issue Requests. This works
      exactly as with Diplomacy, except that if the check fails, the
      target creature will become hostile as a result. Because of this
      added factor of danger, characters whose Bluff skill exceeds
      their Diplomacy skill will always be asked which they want to
      use when issuing a request -- they can then choose to use their
      lower Diplomacy score and have less chance of success, but not
      risk causing the creature to become hostile.\n
      __Using Bluff to issue requests (i.e., trick people into doing
      things for you) is an unlawful act unless it is used on
      monstrous creatures that aren't well recognized as people by
      human society, and is an evil act if used on non-evil creatures.\n
      __<15>* <11>Deceptive Diplomacy:<3> In certain circumstances use
      of the Diplomacy skill is considered to be deceptive, and it thus
      requires the Bluff skill to support it. In these cases, the 
      Diplomacy skill check suffers a -1 penalty for every point by
      which the target's Appraise skill exceeds the skill user's
      Bluff skill.\n
      __<15>* <11>Taunt (Talking):<3> The Bluff skill can be used to taunt other
      characters, causing them to run up and attack you in melee as if
      affected by the spell <9>dire charm<3>. This requires a successful
      skill check against a DC of 10 + twice the target's Will save
      bonus.\n\n

      <8>Unimplemented Uses:\n
      __<15>* <11>Exclusive Guilds (Passive):<3> Certain guilds do not allow
      members of other guilds to join them, as a result of competitive
      practices or old enimities between them -- the Thieves and
      Assassins, Justicars and Templars, the different mercenary
      orders, etc. A very high (15+) Bluff skill can allow a character
      to circumvent most of these restrictions by leading a kind of
      double-life using alternate identities. There is no check
      involved here; all that is required is a certain level of Bluff
      on a case-by-case basis.\n
      __<15>* <11>Evade Justice (Passive):<3> When a player character angers the
      guard in a town or city through criminal activities, a Bluff
      check can be used to deny evidence and get off the hook. These
      checks start relatively easy, but every such check made increases
      the DC of all future checks for the same town or city by +2. This
      modifier is culmulative and never goes away.\n
      __<15>* <11>Reputation Buffer (Passive):<3> When a character
      performs actions that would normally permanently damage his
      reputation and leave him with penalties to social interactions
      (notably killing friendly creatures outside of a dungeon), the
      Bluff skill gives that character a kind of buffer, allowing him
      to wheedle his way out of otherwise incriminating and damaging
      situations. Enough psychopathic behaviour will still end up with
      the character being unable to take allies and being shunned by
      all but the most chaotic and evil, but a character with Bluff
      as a high-rated class skill has much more leeway in this regard
      than most characters do.";

Text "help::climb"
  {
    "The Climb skill can be used in several different ways. Most of the
    passive applications can be invoked with the Ascend and Descend
    commands -- the same ones used to climb up and down stairs.\n
    __<15>* <11>Climb Vines/Trees (Passive):<3> A character with a Climb
    skill rating of 7+ can climb trees (or giant mushrooms) and move about 
    above the ground in a wooded area by standing in a square with a tree
    in it ans using the Ascend command. This does not require a skill check,
    merely the listed skill rating. The Descend command returns the character
    to ground level. If you are struck for damage while climbing in trees, 
    you must make a Climb check against DC 10 + 2 per 5~ of your total hit 
    points suffered. Failure means you suffer falling damage, the terrain 
    effects of whatever square you are climbing over and you become prone.\n
    __A skill check against DC 13 allows a character to move from tree to tree
    while elevated in this manner; with a skill check against DC 25, the character
    is even able to use the Jump skill as if she were on the ground. When climbing
    in trees, a character gains a bonus to hit and to her defense class equal to
    2 + 1/6th of her Climb skill, and also benefits from 25~ cover against missile
    attacks.\n
    __Casting a spell while climbing in trees requires a Climb check against DC
    15; failure causes you to fall, and to botch the spell.\n
    __<15>* <11>Descend Chasm Safely (Passive):<3> With a Climb check against DC
    15, a character standing on the edge of a chasm can attempt to descend
    to the level below safely, coming to rest in the nearest safe square
    one dungeon level below where she began.\n
    __<15>* <11>Ascend Level (Passive):<3> If you fall down a chasm or trapdoor
    trap, you can attempt a Climb roll to climb back up to the level 
    you were on. You need to have a Climb score of at least +12 to 
    attempt this, you must have rope equal to the distances to the nearest
    ledge and you need to succeed on a Climb check versus DC 20. Failure means 
    that you suffer the falling damage again. Anytime you are underground and 
    the game tells you there is no ceiling, you can climb up to the level 
    above -- you can recognize these areas because the floor will be cyan,
    and the status bar will include '(open above)'.\n
    __Failing the Climb check causes falling damage. The <9>fly<3> spell
    allows you to ascend in such areas automatically, but <9>levitate<3>
    is insufficient, as you cannot use it to rise very far above the
    ground.\n
    __<15>* <11>Escape Pit Trap (Passive):<3> Attempting to get out
    of a pit trap requires a Climb check, usually against DC 20.
    Failing the check causes you to suffer the effects of the trap
    (falling damage, poisoned spikes, etc.) again, as you climb
    partially out and then fall.\n
    __<15>* <11> Climb Along Ceiling (Passive):<3> If you have an 
    Climb skill rating of 20+ (probably throuh <9>spider climb<3>), 
    you can climb on the roof of the dungeon. You can ascend 
    whenever you're standing next to a wall. On the ceiling, you 
    get a bonus to Hide equal to +6 +1/3 your Climb skill, can walk 
    over creatures undetected, are at a higher layer and gain the 
    same combat benefits as a character climbing in trees, save for 
    the cover. You also avoid traps and terrain effects.\n
    __You have no Dex bonus when climbing on the ceiling, and it 
    costs 1 Fatigue to make the climb up. Your movement rate is 30~
    normal, +5~ per point of Climb above 20. On one in thirty movement 
    actions while climbing on the ceiling you must make a Climb check 
    against DC 25. If you fail, you fall; if you score less than 35, 
    the effort costs you one fatigue. Furthermore, if you are struck 
    for damage while on the ceiling, you must make a Climb check 
    against DC 25 + 2 per 5~ of your total hit points suffered.
    Failure means you suffer falling damage, the terrain effects
    of whatever square you are climbing over and you become 
    prone.\n
    __Casting a spell while climbing on the ceiling requires a Climb 
    check against DC 25; failure causes you to fall, and to botch the 
    spell. Even if you succeed, the casting requires 15 phases more
    than usual, unless the spell is Stilled and thus does not require
    somatic gestures.\n\n
      
    <8>Unimplemented Uses:\n
    __<15>* <11>Climb Structures (Passive):<3> On the city map, you can 
    use the Climb skill to climb up on top of any building or barrier,
    including the city walls (which is counted as criminal if the
    city guard sees you). Climbing buildings may also allow you to
    enter some buildings by upper floor windows, which it rumoured to
    be the only way to enter certain locations (such as the thieves'
    guild and some wizards' towers). The DC of the Climb check is 
    determined by the structure in question.\n
    __Characters who have ascended buildings have significant bonuses
    to Hide and to attack and damage rolls, and if not standing near
    the edge of a building they simply cannot be seen by other creatures
    withour exceptional sense abilities.\n
    __<15>* <11>Cross Mountains (Passive):<3> You must have the Climb 
    skill and possess a rating of at least +10 in order to travel across
    mountains on the wilderness map. Any terrain survival checks you
    make in mountanous areas use the lower of your Climb and Wilderness
    Lore skills.";

Text "help::concentration"
  { "__The Concentration skill has these applications:\n
      __<15>* <11>Cast while Distracted (Passive):<3> The primary function
      of the Concentration skill is being able to cast spells successfully
      while in difficult circumstances. Every point of Concentration rating
      above +5 cancels a 5~ increase is spell failure chance due to status
      conditions or enviornment. Multiple distractions form a culmulative
      spellcasting penalty that Concentration is subtracted from as a whole
      -- it isn't counted seperately against each penalty, so strong
      Concentration rating can be very valuable to melee spellcasters.
      The following situations all impose penalties to spellcasting:\n
      __<7>Attacks:<3> Spellcasting in melee provokes attacks of opportunity
      unless the Defensive Spell feat is used; if these attacks inflict
      damage on the caster, his spell may be disrupted. Every 1~ of the
      caster's total hit points lost to these attacks adds a 3~ chance of
      spell failure, so a caster who loses 20~ of his hit points to an
      attack of opportunity from spellcasting also suffers a -60~ chance
      of spell success.\n
      __<7>Stunning/Nausea:<3> A stunned or nauseated character suffers a 
      -50~ chance of spell success.\n
      __<7>Confusion:<3> A confused character suffers a -75~ chance to
      spell success, and if they suffer spell failure, the spell may have
      an odd or unintended effect.\n
      __<7>Grappling/Stuck:<3> A character locked in a grapple suffers a
      -30~ spell success chance (assuming use of the Still Spell feat,
      without which a Grappled character cannot cast at all), and a
      character that has become stuck (such as from a <9>web<3> spell or
      the strands from a tanglefoot bag) suffers a -20~ chance of spell
      success.\n
      __<7>Distraction:<3> A caster successfully distracted by a use of
      the Bluff skill suffers a spell success penalty equal to 5~ per two
      points the Bluff check exceeded the spellcaster's distraction DC.\n   
      __<7>Terrain:<3> Swimming or being waist-deep in mud grants a -15~ 
      penalty to spell success.\n
      __<7>Hunger:<3> Being Starving inflicts a -15~ spell success penalty,
      and being Weak from hunger increases that penalty to -30~.\n
      __<7>Spell Effects:<3> Spells such as <9>insect plague<3>, <9>control
      winds<3> or <9>hideous laughter<3> penalize spellcasting as described
      under the spell in question.\n

      penalty to spellcasting.\n
      __Note that Concentration does <11>not<3> cancel penalties to spell
      success chance from wearing armour, low Intelligence or fighting
      defensively.\n
      __<15>* <11>Reduce Penalties (Passive):<3> An exceptional Concentration
      skill gives a character a heightened ability to resist pain, and a
      high Concentration skill will lessen the attack and damage penalties
      inflicted by magical effects that cause pain, such as <9>pain touch<3>,
      weapons of pain or a <9>symbol of pain<3>. If a character has Concentration
      as a class skill and a rating of +10, the sum of all her pain penalties are 
      reduced by 1; at +12, this increases to 2, at +14, 3, at +16, 4, and so
      forth.\n
      __<15>* <11>Contests of Will (Passive):<3> Some spells and magical
      items (notably <9>spiritwrack<3> and the various <9>planar conjuration<3>
      spells) require the caster to engage in a contest of wills with another
      creature, which is resolved an opposed Concentration check -- whichever
      character scores higher wins.\n
      __<15>* <11>Break Paralysis (Passive):<3> Characters with a 15+ rating
      in Concentration are able to overcome paralysis effects through sheer
      force of will. If they fail a saving throw against a paralysis effect,
      they receive an additional Fortitude save against DC 18 every turn
      until they have beaten the effect.\n
      __Characters with this ability are also able to move when paralyzed

      Nauseated -- a state which normally prevents a character from
      attacking. A DC 20 Concentration check is required, and failing
      this check costs the character a full 40 segments without any
      action being taken, and provokes an attack of opportunity.\n
      __<15>* <11>Psionic Focus (Active, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> When a character is not in
      combat and not in the immediate presence of hostile creatures, she
      may spend a fatigue point and make a Concentration check (DC 15)
      to gain a state of psionic focus (which can be expended to augment
      psionic powers in various ways, fulfilling a vaguely similar role
      to metamagic for spellcasters). Failure causes the fatigue point to
      be wasted, but the attempt can be made freely again on the character's
      next turn without any further penalty.\n
      __<15>* <11>Train Wisdom (Passive):<3> The techniques of meditation
      and mental focus a character learns in developing the Concentration
      skill serve as an excelent springboard for heightening perception
      and strengthening the will overall. Concentration can be used to
      train the Wisdom attribute in the same manner that Athletics is used
      to train the three physical attributes.";

  { "__The Craft skill has these applications:\n
    __<15>* <11>Repair Items (Active):<3> The Craft skill can be used
    to repair items which have become damaged as a result of magical
    attacks, acid, rust or any of the other rigors of the dungeon. 
    Mending a metal item requires access to a forge, and mending any
    item demands a set of craftsman's tools. To repair items, a Craft
    skill check is made against a base DC of 10, plus a modifier based
    on the power of an item if it is magical (more advanced magical
    items require more careful craftwork!), +1 for every 10~ of its
    hit points the item is missing, +2 per previous failed attempt to
    repair this item.\n
    __Repairing an item normally takes two hour, but if the craftsman
    values the item highly, she may decide to work slowly, taking 8
    hours instead and receiving a +4 bonus to the skill check. A
    successful Craft check repairs a number of hit points of damage
    to equal to 2d8 + 1/3rd of the crafter's Craft skill rating.
    __Failing a repair DC by 5 or more actually damages the item
    further, inflicting an additional 1d8 points of damage.\n
    __<15>* <11>Temper Masterwork (Active):<3> By tempering and
    reforging a sword or other item, a character can preserve it in
    a state of perfect flawlessness - a masterwork. Crafting a
    weapon so that it becomes a masterwork in this manner requires
    a Craft skill of at least +12. A masterwork weapon gains a bonus
    to damage of +1 at Craft +12, +2 at Craft +17, +3 at Craft +22
    and so forth. After being used on combat over a period of time,
    a masterwork blade can lose its edge and revert to being a
    normal weapon, requiring the crafter to temper it again. The DC
    to temper an item is 15 + the dungeon depth such an item would
    be typically found at. Doing this takes 6 hours.\n
    __Only long blades, short blades and daggers can be tempered.
    As always, working with metallic items requires a forge.\n
    __<15>* <11>Dwarven Weaponcraft (Active):<3> The dwarven ability
    to create magical weapons and armour is limited by the Crafts
    skill. A dwarf using this ability can create items roughly equal
    to what would be found at a depth equal to her Craft skill rating
    -- a dwarf with Crafts +8 could create items typically found on
    dungeon level 8. Note that the <11>best<3> items found on a given
    level of the dungeon are typically somewhat 'out of depth', being
    excepyional for the depth they are found at.\n
    __<15>* <11>Craft Dragon-Armour (Active, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3>
    If a character exceptionally skilled with Craft should be fortunate 
    enough to slay a dragon of young adult age or older, she can use
    her skill to craft dragon scale mail armour from the beast's remains.
    Doing this requires that the dragon corpse be dissected in order to
    obtain dragon scales, and then a forge found at which the character
    can work. Creating dragon scale mail requires a Craft skill of at
    least +15, eight hours of work and a Craft check against a DC of 20
    plus the dragon's age category. Failing this check causes the dragon
    scales to be wasted and the attempt to create armour fails.\n
    __If the check is successful, the armour gains the base traits of
    normal scale mail, but its base armour values are increased by +1
    per age category of the dragon; additionally, it conveys either a
    saving throw bonus or an elemental resistance equal is magnitude to
    twice the dragon's age category -- for example, scale mail made from
    the hide of an adult red dragon would grant Fire Resistance 12.\n
    __Dragonskin is supple and almost infinitely adaptable in the hands
    of a truly skilled craftsman. For every three points the base DC is
    beaten by, the mail's armour check penalty decreases by one, to a
    minimum of 0.";

Text "help::decipher script"
  { "__The Decipher Script skill has the following applications:\n
      __<15>* <11>Read Scrolls (Passive):<3> The primary use of the Decipher
      Script skill is reading magical scrolls; this may be attempted
      regardless of whether the character actually has the skill.
      The base DC to successfully read a scroll is 20 for a scroll
      of a 'buff' spell, 15 for an offensive spell and 10 for a general
      purpose spell. Added to this is twice the spell level, minus 1.\n
      __Characters have a +5 competance bonus to read any spell from a
      scroll that is on their class spell list, that they have access
      to at their current level. (Note the difference between chart
      levels and spell access as described in the Multiclass Spellcasters
      section.) If a character reads a scroll of a spell they actually
      know and are able to cast normally, the casting is automatically
      successful and costs no mana.\n
      __If the reader's Decipher Script check beats the required DC by
      10 or more, the reader has a 50~ chance of being able to preserve
      the scroll and use it again.\n
      __The effective caster level of a scroll-read spell is the higher
      of twice the spell's level minus one and the reader's Decipher
      Script level - 2. Thus, low-level characters with high Decipher
      Script skills can often produce impressive castings from scrolls.
      It takes [50 - (Decipher Script x 2)] segments to read a scroll,
      to a minimum of 10 segments.\n
      __<15>* <11>Damaged Spellbooks (Passive):<3> When a mage attempts
      to cast a spell that she only has in a spellbook that has suffered
      damage, a Decipher Script check is necessary to make out the
      partially illegible text. This check has a DC of 10 + 1 per 10~ of
      the spellbook's hit points that have been lost.\n
      __<15>* <11>Item Identification (Passive):<3> Certain items of
      various types are identified by the game as 'runed', 'enscribed',
      'rune-covered' or so forth. By reading these runes with the 
      Decipher Script skill, a character may be able to identify the
      item. This requires that the character actually have the Decipher
      Script skill as a class skill, and requires a check against a DC
      of 10 + twice the item's level. This check is made automatically
      at the same time Intuition information is gained; success reveals
      the item's plus and magical nature to the player.";

Text "help::diplomacy"
  { "__Diplomacy is a very broad and open-ended skill with the following
     possible applications:\n
      __<15>* <11>Increased PCR (Passive):<3> The total
      possible CR of your party -- your PCR -- is increased
      by your Diplomacy rating. If adding a creature to your
      party would cause the party's total CR to exceed
      your PCR, that creature won't be able to join
      unless you dismiss someone else. You must have a
      Diplomacy score above +5 for it to impact your PCR;
      every full +5 after the first increases the maximum
      possible size of your party by 100~.\n
      __Creatures whose Personality Archetypes or
      alignments conflict with your own or with other
      members of your party have an inflated effective
      CR when it comes to determining their role in the
      calculation of PCR. This inflation is reduced by
      a high Diplomacy level on the player character's
      part. Thus, it requires an exceptional Diplomacy
      skill to maintain a party with both good and
      evil characters of any reasonable power in a 
      stable manner.\n
      __<15>* <11>Issue Request (Active):<3> One of the 
      possible uses for Diplomacy is the ability to 
      give non-hostile, non-friendly NPCs requests. The 
      creature must be intelligent, and unlike a true 
      ally he will not cross from one map to another 
      with the PC -- his aid is purely situational.\n
      __Orders that can be given vary. NPCs can be
      asked to give the PC items that they picked up
      in the dungeon (this is difficult), but not
      items that are part of their inherent equipment.
      NPCs can also be persuaded to attack other
      creatures that are already hostile to them --
      in other words, their priority of enemies can
      be changed.\n
      __Perhaps the most useful order a player can
      give is to get an NPC to follow her. By so
      doing, the player can lead an NPC to other
      creatures that they hate -- demons vs. devils,
      elves vs. drow, good vs. evil, etc. -- and
      allow the NPC to fight the player's battles
      for him. Once a player has successfully used
      Diplomacy on a given NPC, he receives half of
      the experience for all the creatures that NPC
      kills, for the remainder of the day Diplomacy
      was used in. However, creatures that the
      player guides in this manner do not count as
      party members for party Hit Dice purposes --
      they are still neutrals, not allies.\n
      __Diplomacy cannot be used to give a creature
      orders in the same day it was used to change
      that creature from hostile to neutral, and
      every order given after the first in a single
      day increases the DC by +2.\n
      __The DC for a Diplomacy check to convince a
      creature to do something depends on your race,
      the creature's race, the request given, your
      Personality Archetype, the creature's alignment
      and so forth. The one factor that always applies, 
      however, is CR -- the target creature's CR is
      always added to the DC of an Issue Request check.
      __This function of Diplomacy can also be used to
      convince creatures to barter with you when they
      otherwise would not be willing -- dwarves will
      not trade with drow or orcs without an impressive
      check, for example.\n
      __Storekeepers sell to anyone, but they are often
      more reluctant to buy wares from dungeon delvers
      (as opposed to trade guilds). Whether they will
      purchase items often depends on a character's base
      Diplomacy skill rating, modified by the normal
      social modifiers. For example, Roark Ironbeard
      will purchase powerful magical weapons and armour
      only from characters with an adjusted Diplomacy
      rating of +12.\n
      __<15>* <11>Enlist Aid (Talking):<3> When you ask
      a named character to join your party, a Diplomacy
      check determines if they are willing, modified by
      Personality Archetypes, alignment, race, etc. You
      only get one check against a given character in
      this circumstance, <11>ever<3>.\n
      __Unlike most Diplomacy checks, this one cannot
      be modified by magical bonuses, because it 
      represents a long-term commitment on the NPC's
      part.\n
      __The DC of an Enlist Aid check is 15 + twice the
      affected character's CR.\n
      __<15>* <11>Dismiss Ally (Talking):<3> Conversely, the 
      Diplomacy skill can be used to get a character to
      leave your party on graceful terms. When you elect
      to dismiss a character, they will automatically cease
      to be an ally and become a neutral character. The
      success or failure of the Diplomacy check determines
      if they can be added back into your party reliably at
      a later time. If you fail the Dismiss Ally check, you
      need to make the Enlist Aid check again, and if that
      check fails, the character is permanently closed to
      you as a party member as usual.\n
      __If you succeed, you can automatically add the
      character in question back into your party at any
      time in the future, provided you have enough free
      PCR.\n
      __The DC of a Dismiss Ally check is 7 + the affected
      character's CR, and the check does not fail on a 
      natural one.\n
      __<15>* <11>Haggling (Passive):<3> Your Diplomacy rating 
      is used internally by the game in calculating shop and
      barter prices, along with racial affinities, personality
      modifiers and so forth. Note that regardless of exceptional
      Charisma and Diplomacy, characters will still always find
      that there is a very steep difference between buying and
      selling price in Incursion. Adventurers are a very tiny,
      very volatile customer base, and merchants trading in magic
      items must allocate a massive portion of their budget to
      the protection and procurement of their wares.\n
      __An average human character can expect to sell goods for 
      1/20th of their base price and buy them for five times their 
      base price. A character with maxed-out Diplomacy and Charisma
      can expect to sell items for 1/10th their base price and buy
      them for 2-3 times their base price.\n
      __More significantly, however, Diplomacy determines how much
      gold a merchant, adventurer or shop is willing to part with.
      A merchant may have 10,000 gp worse of loose cash, but being
      frugally smart only want to spent 3,000 gp to purchase new
      wares. Every point of a character's Diplomacy increases the
      amount of cash a merchant can be persuaded to use to purchase
      goods by 5~, up to an obvious maximum of the total amount of
      cash the merchant has.\n
      __Forcing sellers to expend too much of their operating finances
      buying items from you can impact your alignment.\n
      __<15>* <11>Barter for Services (Talking):<3> In addition to
      buying items from NPCs, a player character can buy services --
      usually the casting of spells -- from them. Spells that can
      be purchased from NPCs include Identify, Remove Curse, Cure
      spells, Restoration, and so forth, as well as certain extended
      protective magics like Resist Fire, Misdirection or Stoneskin.\n
      __As with items, Diplomacy influences the price of service spells,
      and a Diplomacy check (DC 5/10 + caster's CR, with modifiers based
      on race, alignment, etc.) is required to convince a caster to
      sell magic to you. Arcane casters are easier to convince to
      merchandise their magic (base DC 5) than divine casters (base DC
      10).\n
      __<15>* <11>Resolve Conflict (Active):<3> A Diplomacy check can
      be used to convince a hostile character to become neutral in some
      circumstances. The DC for this differs wildly -- it's not hard to
      calm down an angry goblin, but inherently evil and vicious creatures
      like demons can be very hard to make peace with. In some circumstances,
      a creature will want something -- often a bribe -- in order to stop
      attacking you.\n
      __You cannot make creatures neutral to you with Diplomacy if you
      have already attacked them; for that, use Bluff.\n
      __<15>* <11>Surrender (Active):<3> When you choose to surrender to
      attacking NPCs, a fairly easy Diplomacy check is made; success
      causes the NPCs to accept your surrender and become neutral, taking
      all your gold and your best item in so doing. If you beat the check
      DC by 10 or more, you can reduce the amount of wealth and goods
      enemies take from you when you surrender.\n
      __Returning to attack enemies you have surrendered to is an unlawful
      act; if the enemies aren't themselves evil, it is also an evil act.";

    __Though the Disguise skill only has one use, that use
    has several different effects, as follows; note that
    none of these effects apply if the creatures in question

    __<15>* <11>Affect Hostility:<3> The primary function
    of Disguise is to affect the hostility of other

    are disguised unless you strike them again while in a
    given disguise. Creatures that are hostile to you
    because you are 'the player character invading the

    disguised. Creatures that are hostile to you based
    on racial enemity will re-evaluate you based on the

    The Handle Device skill is also used
    to operate mechanical weapons skillfully. Gnomes begin with
    these kinds of weapons, and other character may buy them, find
    them in the dungeon or take them from slain gnomes. Characters
    that do not have the Handle Device skill are not considered to
    be proficient with mechanical weapons, even if they would be
    proficient with a normal weapon of the type. Characters that
    possess te skill are proficient with any kind of mechanical
    weapon that they have the appropriate normal weapon group
    proficiency for.\n
    __Additionally, characters with this skill receive bonuses of
    various kinds when using mechanical weapons, as follows:\n
    __<7>Polearms:<3> Mechanical polearms have spring-loaded telescoping
    hafts that can change length freely to accomodate their user's
    desire. These weapons add their wielder's [Handle Device / 3]
    to the DC of the saving throw to close with the wielder, and
    if the wielder has a Handle Device score of +10 or higher, they
    can be used to attack a target who is inside the normal reach
    in which a polearm of the type in question would be ineffective.\n
    __<7>Daggers / Knives:<3> Mechanical daggers or knives have various
    concealed or spring-loaded blades, whether the primary blade of
    the weapon or a secondary edge. On one in three attacks, the
    wielder can use this function to surprise an opponent, treating
    them as off-guard if they can beat them on an opposed Handle
    Device vs. Spot check.\n
    __<7>Bows:<3> Mechanical conventional bows feature elaborate balances
    and pulley systems to direct force and channel torque, allowing
    the wielder to substitute (10 + [Handle Device / 2]) for her
    Strength score (if beneficial) when using them.\n
    __<7>Flexible Weapons:<3> Flails, whips, spiked chains and similar 
    weapons typically replace the chain with a very intricately 
    crafted mechanical tentacle that flows easily where guided until 
    a slight shift 'locks' it into its current form, turning the
    weapon rigid and potentially trapping weapons or limbs. This
    allows the wielder to add [Handle Device / 3] to the DC of
    saving throws against being tripped or disarmed by a mechanical
    flexible weapon.\n
    __<7>Crossbows:<3> Gnomish crossbows are fit with special sights made
    with ground glass lenses, allowing their wielder to aim her
    shots very precisely. They add [Handle Device / 5] to their
    threat range when used by a competant bearer.";

Text "help::healing"
  { "__The Heal skill has the following uses. Note that in all cases
    except Improved Healing, a character can only try to treat a given
    ailment once per day using the Heal skill. The Heal skill requires
    a kit to use, and cannot be used in combat.\n
    __<15>* <11>Improved Healing (Active):<3> Normally, characters
    heal ([Character Level + 3] x Constitution) / 5 hit points worth of
    damage every time they rest for a night. However, characters that
    have Heal as a class skill instead heal ([Character Level + Heal
    Skill Rating + 3] x Constitution) / 5 hit points per night, which
    can easily be enough to restore even mid-level characters from
    seriously wounded to fully healed overnight.\n 
    __<15>* <11>Treat Attribute Damage (Active):<3> The base DC for a
    Heal check to treat Attribute Damage is 10 + 2 per point of damage
    the attribute has suffered. Beating this DC heals one point of
    attribute damage, plus one per full 5 points the character's check
    result exceeds the base DC by.
    __Characters can only treat attribute damage with Heal once per
    day, and they cannot treat both disease or poison and attribute
    damage in the same day. In this specific case, the player must
    choose whether it's better tactically to treat the damage to an
    attribute, or to try and remove the cause of that damage -- the
    poison or disease -- overall.\n 
    __<15>* <11>Staunch Bleeding (Active):<3> The Heal skill can also
    be used to stop bleeding. This requires a skill check against a DC
    of 10 plus 3 times the number of hit points being lost per turn as
    a result of bleeding.\n
    __<15>* <11>Treat Blindness (Active):<3> A truly skilled healer
    may be able to cure blindness. This requires a Heal check against
    DC 30 (permanant blindness), DC 25 (blindness lasting days), or DC
    10-20 (blindness with a shorter-term duration).\n
    __<15>* <11>Treat Poison/Disease (Active):<3> A Heal check can be
    made to attempt to treat a poison or disease, but only once per
    affliction. The DC of the heal check is the same as the DC of the
    Fortitude saving throw against the disease or poison. A variable
    number of successful Fortitude saving throws are required to
    overcome a specific disease or poison. A successful Heal check
    counts as at least one successful saving throw; for every +5 the
    check exceeds the base DC by, it counts as another successful
    save against the poison or disease. Thus, a sufficiently high
    Heal check can purge a poison or disease instantly, while a
    less overwhelming one will at least lessen its effect and speed
    the time it takes for the character's body to overcome it
    naturally.\n
    __<15>* <11>Forestall Petrification (Active):<3> Petrification is
    a magical effect, and the Healing skill alone cannot cure it.
    However, by the application of careful herbal remedies and other
    obscure treatments, a successful Heal check against DC 20 can
    delay the onset of petrification by [Heal Skill x 20] combat
    rounds.";

    the invisibility is broken the second that you attack, use a light source stronger 
    than a torch or otherwise draw attention to yourself. You can only Hide when you are 
    out of sight of all monsters hostile to you. You will receive a warning if you are
    about to move into a brightly lit area, ending your hiding.\n
    __There is no Hide skill check; instead, when a character hides, a random adjustment
    between -5 and +5 is assigned to their Hide skill, and this adjustment is compared
    to the Spot skill of creatures nearby them; if an observer's Spot skill rating exceeds
    the character's adjusted Hide, that creature can then perceive the hiding character.\n
    __When a hiding creature steps next to a hostile creature, they may be given away by
    sound (as described under Move Silently), and which point they are no longer hiding 
    and become visible to everyone -- presumably the creature they stepped close to speaks
    or takes actions that make their presence apparent. Hiding creatures who do not step

    __<15>* <11>Cow Enemies (Talking):<3> Through a display of force or merely an
    expert display of threatening body language, a fearsome character can terrorize
    her enemies. By making an Intimidate check against a base DC of 15 + her most
    powerful foe's Will save modifier, adjusted for the apparent strength of the
    player's group in contrast with the monsters', a player can cause a group of
    monsters to become shaken, suffering a -2 morale penalty to all rolls. If she
    beats the DC by 10 or more, her foes will rout, fleeing in a mad panic.\n 
    __<15>* <11>Coerce Service (Talking):<3> Intimidate can also be used to extract
    service from other characters through threat of violence. This works essentially
    identically to issuing requests with Diplomacy, except that a failed check

    frightened creatures as well as neutral ones, whereas Diplomacy can only be
    used on neutral creatures.\n

    creature in that monster's group that witnessed the act must roll a Will saving
    throw against a DC of the character's [Intimidate + 5]; on a failure, creatures
    of CR 3 or lower become afraid, and others become shaken, suffering a morale

    feelings about items picked up in the dungeon, telling you if they are good,

    and warriors who lack divination magics or Clairsentient arts. Normally, a

    of hunch about it, and the Intuition check will be made immediately after

    the lock on the door, but 15 is typical in the earlier dungeon levels.
    This check may only be made once per day, but if it is failed the
    character can try again the next day with a +4 retry bonus. The bonus
    increases to +6 on the third day, then +8, etc. -- eventually a
    character will be able to pick a given lock regardless of their skill.\n
    __If a character fails to pick a lock and does not have time to lose,
    they can attempt to force the door open by kicking it. This has several
    disadvantages -- it makes noise, which will wake up sleeping monsters
    and attract others, and if the door is trapped kicking it will trigger
    the trap automatically, but picking the lock does not.\n 
    __<15>* <11>Unlock Chests (Passive):<3> Similarly, the Lockpicking skill
    can be used to open locked chests. Chests can also be forced by striking
    them, but this risks breaking fragile items contained inside the chest,
    such as potions or scrolls, and will automatically trigger any traps on
    the chest.";

     in Shadows skill) or invisible due to magic, or when she cannot be
     visually perceived for any other reason, the Move Silently skill
     comes into play. As long as she stays at least 10 feet (one square)
     away from all other creatures, her existing methods of imperceptibility
     are sufficient. However, when she moves directly beside another creature
     or attempts to attack, an opposed skill check is made with the creature

Text "help::mining"
  {
    "__The Mining skill has these uses:\n
        __<15>* <11>Discern Value (Passive):<3> In addition to actual mining, the 
      Mining skill allows you to discern the location of deposits of diamonds, 
      gold, gemstones and valuable magical metals such as adamant, orichalcum or
      mithril -- your character is able to perceive where these deposits lie
      by analyzing the composition and formations of the stone around her.
      This perception is automatic and reaches out to a range of 1/2 your
      Mining skill rating in squares; this range is extended by 3 squares for
      characters with the Stonework Sense ability. These deposits appear on
      screen as rock glyphs, usually isolated islands in the middle of solid
      stone, that are coloured differently than the normal rock that composes
      the dungeon -- bright white for diamonds, silver or mithril, yellow for
      gold, various bright colours for gemstones, dark grey for adamant, etc.\n
      __Characters that do not have the Mining skill cannot perceive deposits,
      even if they have a significant untrained skill rating. Furthermore, only
      digging releases the mineral treasure from a deposit -- since the metals
      or gemstones are essentially part of the stone, catching a deposit in the
      area of a <9>transmute rock to mud<3> spell destroys the treasure along
      with the stone.\n 
      __<15>* <11>Mining (Active):<3> Using the Mining skill puts a character
      into digging mode; in this mode simply walking into walls will cause
      you to mine through them. A character's rating in the Mining skill 
      determines what materials she can penetrate when digging. The character's
      skill rating plus a modifier based on the tool they are using must exceed 
      the Hardness of the material in question, otherwise mining cannot occur.
      Thus, characters with low Mining will be able to dig through streamers
      but not normal rock, while a character with a magical digging implement
      and a truly exceptional digging tool might even be able to dig through
      an adamant wall!\n
      __The difference between a character's level in the Mining skill and the
      hardness of the material they are digging through is also the factor used
      to calculate how long mining out a single square, and how much Fatigue,
      if any, is lost in so doing.\n
      __Finally, when the character successfully mines through a vein or deposit
      containing treasure, the amount of precious materials that can be recovered
      intact in the mining process is modified by the Mining skill level, as well
      as the depth the deposit was found at.\n
      __<15>* <11>Structural Integrity:<3> Dungeons have already been heavily
      shaped and altered by human hands, and casual excavation not planned for
      in their initial creation places a strain on their geological integrity.
      Fortunately, a skillful miner can choose to remove stone in ways that
      minimize the strain on existing structures and grant a safe, well-
      supported mineshaft that stretches a greater distance. A character can 
      mine out a number of squares on a given level equal to thrice their Mining 
      skill rating safely. After this, every additional percent of that total mined 
      increases the chance of a cave-in (with the same effect as an <9>earthquake<3>
      spell cast at 20th level) by the same percent culmulatively -- so a character 
      with Mining +5 who mines 6 squares has a 20~ chance of cave-in on the sixth, 
      since a single square is 1/5th, or 20~, above the total safe limit. The next 
      square would have a 40~ chance of collapse, and so forth...";

      bards who intend to make effective use of this class feature.\n
      __<15>* <11>Stage Performance (Active, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> Characters with the
      Perform skill can enter different taverns and hold performances,
      gaining gold from the managers and appreuciative audience. Initiaally,
      this can be quite lucrative relative to a character of any level, but
      performing for cash remains valuable only so long as the performer is
      a novelty in the area. A performer can perform only once per night per
      locale, and every additional performance in the same locale ever turns
      in only half of what the last performance at that locale did.\n
      __Obviously, then, characters with a high Perform skill have a strong
      motive to travel from city to city in order to maximize the financial
      rewards this skill can bring them.\n
      __<15>* <11>Recruit Allies (Passive):<3> The Perform skill aids in
      the recruitment of party members (as described under Diplomacy) --
      by telling enthralling tales of her heroic exploits, a character with
      the Perform skill makes joining her party seem a much more attractive
      proposition. In game terms, 1/3rd of the character's Perform skill
      rating is added to the Diplomacy check to enlist a new party member,
      provided that the player character has Perform as a class skill.\n

    "__Contrary to it's name, this skill encompasses a wide
    variety of feats of legerdemain and sleight of hand. It
    has the following uses:\n
    __<15>* <11>Theft (Active):<3> The primary use of the Pick
    Pockets skill is removing small items from other character.
    It can be used to steal gold from passing nobles, healing
    potions from foes in battle or even to slip a sword out of
    its sheath.\n
    __There are two seperate DCs involved in a Pick Pockets
    attempt. The first is 15 + the victim's Reflex save modifier
    (and the setting of this DC counts as a saving throw on the
    victim's part, so bonuses like the Protection Domain granted
    power apply); whether this DC is beaten or not determines
    if the attempt to procure an item is successful. The second
    DC is 15 + the victim's Spot rating, and determines if the
    attempt is noticed or not. The DC decreases by 5 if the mark
    can't see the would-be thief. On a failed check, the victim 
    becomes aware of the attempt and likely becomes hostile to 
    the thief; in an urban setting, the guardsmen will become 
    hostile as well. If a hostile creature notices a pick-pocket
    attempt, they get an Attack of Opportunity on the thief.\n
    __The thief must be standing next to the
    character to be pickpocketed. A successful check adds one
    unattended Small item from the victim's possession to the
    skill user's inventory -- the thief can choose from any
    Small, unattended item in the victim's inventory. 
    __Lifting larger items is possible, but increases the DC
    of the attempt by +3 per size category above Small. Removing
    items from a container (like a backpack) gives a +5 DC. If a
    victim is distracted, however (as per the Bluff skill),
    the Pick Pocket DC gains a -10 bonus. Only if the victim
    is distracted can the skill be used to remove worn or
    wielded items; if a rogue removes something their mark
    holds in their hands (i.e., a wielded weapon), or a worn
    cloak or full backpack, the victim will automatically become 
    hostile -- but the thief still has the item. Stealing worn 
    items has a -10 penalty, which effectively cancels the 
    +10 bonus due to distraction.
    __A Pick Pockets attempt takes (40 - skill level) segments,
    to a minimum of 15. It is not possible to use the Pick 
    Pockets skill to remove worn armour.\n
    __<15>* <11>Apportation (Passive):<3> The mage spell <9>apportation<3>
    has an effect similar to the Pick Pockets skill, save for
    being usable at range, and it function depends upon the Pick
    Pockets skill as explained in the spell description.\n
    __<15>* <11>Defense from Theft (Passive):<3> A central element of the
    Pick Pockets skill is understanding all of the tricks and
    techniques that can be used to mislead a mark and seperate
    him from his items. Once these methods are understood, they
    also become far easier to defend against -- characters with
    the Pick Pockets skill as a class skill have a a bonus to
    saving throws against theft equal to a third of their skill 
    rating.\n
    __<15>* <11>Conceal Item (Active, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> The Pick Pockets skill
    can also be used to conceal a small-sized item on one's person.
    Such an item must be placed in a belt inventory slot; using the
    skill in this manner automatically marks the chose item as
    concealed. Such an item will not be removed from a character
    when they enter an area where some items (like weapons, holy
    symbols, spellbooks and other items capable of producing 
    offensive effects) are not allowed -- such as taverns, which
    do not permit weapons and automatically remove them from a
    player character upon entry.\n
    __With a Pick Pockets skill of 12 or greater, a character can
    even conceal items from magical detection, preventing them
    from being stripped from her upon passing through certain
    magical portals that normally remove most or all items.\n
    __<15>* <11>Catch Thrown Weapons (Passive):<3> In addition to larceny,
    this skill covers forms of sleight of hand used in service
    to entertainment, such as juggling. This kind of coordination
    can be put to a more practical use by snatching items out of
    the air when thrown at a character. When a character with a
    Pick Pockets rating of 15+ and Pick Pockets as a class skill
    is targeted with a thrown weapon, he may make a Pick Pockets
    check to catch the weapon, avoiding any damage to himself if
    successful. The DC of this check is 11 + 1/2 the total result
    of the thrower's attack roll.\n

    If the character has [???], he can immediately throw the caught
    weapon at any target of his choice as an attack of opportunity.";

    "Poison Use gives a rogue or assassin a broad understanding
    of poisons and their use on the battlefield; it has the
    following applications:\n
    __<15>* <11>Poison Familiarity (Passive):<3> Characters are
    considered to be familiar with poisons based on their rating
    in the Poison Use skill. Most characters cannot identify what
    type of poison is on a blade or in a vial when they look at
    such, but characters with Poison Use as a class skill can
    recognize any poison whose base save DC is equal to or lower 
    than their [Poison Use +5].\n
    __<15>* <11>Create Poisons (Passive):<3> Poisons are alchemical
    items and are created just like other alchemical items are --
    an active use of the Alchemy skill. However, a character must
    have both the Poison Use and Alchemy skills as class skills to
    manufacture poisons, must have Poison Use 12+, and the lower of 
    the two skill ratings is used in place of straight Alchemy in 
    the normal process. A character that meets these requirements
    is able to manufacture any poison whose save DC is equal to or
    lower than the lower of her Poison Use or Alchemy skills.\n   
    __<15>* <11>Apply Poison (Active):<3> The primary use of the
    Poison Use skill is applying poisons to weapons. A DC 10 Poison
    Use check allows a character to apply poison; failing this check
    wastes the poison the character was trying to apply. For every 
    three points the character beats the DC 10 base by, the poison 
    will remain potent for another hit with the weapon.\n
    __A character without this skill can still attempt to apply 
    poison to a blade using the Apply verb, but on 1 in 3 failed
    checks she will poison herself!\n
    __<15>* <11>Save DC Increase (Passive):<3> A character's Poison 
    Use skill also educates her in how to use a poisoned weapon most
    effectively, striking to apply the poison to the bloodstream in
    the most direct routes, ensuring it is placed on the blade in
    the most effective manner and so forth. In game terms, when a
    character with Poison Use strikes another with a poisoned weapon,
    the save DC of the poison in increased by a third of her skill
    rating.\n 
    __<15>* <11>Save Bonuses (Passive):<3> A solid knowledge of

    instead of a penalty, as a result of being so agile and graceful in the
    water. As with movement, aquatic creatures suffer no penalty, but gain a
    +1 bonus for every point of Swim above +10.\n";

Text "help::tumble"
  { "__The Tumble skill can be used in these ways:\n
        __<15>* <11>Tumbling (Active):<3> Using this skill allows you to 
      move acrobatically; tumbling uses one fatigue point and lasts for 
      [Tumble Rating + 1d4] turns, but gives several advantages. While tumbling, 
      a character adds half of their Tumble skill rating to their DC 
      versus normal attacks, and their full Tumble skill rating to their 
      DC versus attacks of opportunity provoked by movement. Tumbling 
      increases one's movement rate by [(Skill Rating / 2) x 5~], but decreases
      attack speed by 25~ and increases threat ranges by 2 (after any doublings due
      to keen weapons, Improved Critical, etc.) against any creature whose Wisdom 
      is lower than the tumbler's skill rating.\n
      __<15>* <11>Land Gracefully (Passive):<3> When a character with
      Tumble as a class skill falls, a skill check against DC 20 is made.
      Success allows her to land gracefully, halving the falling damage
      and preventing her from becoming prone.\n
      __<15>* <11>Defensive Roll (Passive):<3> A Tumble skill total of
      15+ is the prerequisite to character that do not receive Defensive
      Roll as a class feature gaining it as a feat.\n
      __<15>* <11>Reflex Saving Throw (Passive):<3> In addition to the
      active benefit, characters with Tumble as a class skill and a rating
      above +5 gain a competance bonus to Reflex saving throws -- +1 at +6,
      +2 at +9, +3 at +12, +4 at +15 and so forth. This is a constant, 
      nonmagical benefit.";

Text "help::Use Magic"
  { "__The Use Magic skill has the following uses:\n
    __<15>* <11>Zap Wand (Passive):<3> The Use Magic skill governs the
    activation of wands. When a character tries to blast a wand, a Use
    Magic check is made against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the wand's level (the
    typical depth it would be found at in a dungeon). If this check is
    successful, the wielder is able to activate the wand. A specialist
    mage gains bonuses when using wands affiliated with his school of
    choice, or related schools, equal to +1 per 5~ of his specialist
    modifier for the school in question. Penalties do not apply to
    oppositional schools, however.\n
    __Some wands have a magical plus, which frequently determines the
    number of dice of damage they inflict, the power of the creatures
    they summon or some other variable factor of their effect. In this
    case, a highly successful Use Magic check has a chance of increasing
    the wand's effective plus, per the following table:\n
    <15>___DC Exceeded________Increased Plus__\n
    <1>___[15 + Wand Depth]________+1________\n
    ___[20 + Wand Depth]________+2________\n
    ___[25 + Wand Depth]________+3________\n
    ___[30 + Wand Depth]________+4________\n
    __<3>This can even raise the temporary effective plus of a wand above
    +5, for the purpose of this single activation.\n
    __<15>* <11>Trick Magic (Passive):<3> A rogue's special ability
      to use class or race-specific magic is based on the sum of her
      Bluff and Use Magic scores.\n";

Text "help::Wilderness Lore"
  { "__The Wilderness Lore skill can be used in these ways:\n
      __<15>* <11>Food Tending (Passive):<3> The Wilderness Lore skill covers
      the cooking and preservation of food in survivalist conditions.
      The Wilderness Lore skill determines how quickly corpses age
      when they are in a character's possession -- if a character with
      Wilderness Lore +9 kills a deer, the meat will last 3 times as
      long in his possession as it will for a character with Wilderness
      Lore +3. The same decay rates apply to food items subject to decay
      that a character with Wilderness Lore can preserve better -- food
      rations never decay, but apples and melons will.\n
      __Wilderness Lore also comes into play when a character eats the
      corpse of a creature not normally used for food. In this case a
      character always has a chance of contracting a disease, and a
      Wilderness Lore check is made against a DC determined by a variety
      of factors, including the age of the corpse, to see if the character
      becomes diseased.\n
      __<15>* <11>Hunting (Active, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> On the overland map, a
      character can use the Wilderness Lore skill in order to hunt for
      food; a successful check takes two hours and moves the character
      to Satiated. Failure can simply result in no suitable food being
      found, or if the check is failed by five or more can throw the
      character into a dangerous encounter with wilderness creatures.\n
      __The DC of this check is determined by the terrain that the
      character is moving through.\n
      __<15>* <11>Harsh Terrain (Passive, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> Some forms of terrain on
      the Wilderness screen are so hostile to life that they require a 
      Wilderness Lore check for every step the character takes. The DC
      of this check is set by the terrain in question, and the effects
      of failing can include encounters, damage, becoming lost (unable
      to control the direction you move on the overland map), equipment
      loss, fatigue, disease and so forth.\n
      __<15>* <11>Resist Weather (Passive, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> Weather effects function
      in Incursion much like harsh terrain, except that they are invisible 
      fields that move about the overland map rather than being fixed in
      one location. The <9>predict weather<3> spell allows these fields
      to be seen. Entering a weather field requires a Wilderness Lore
      check each turn, with much the same effects for failure as harsh
      terrain.\n
      __<15>* <11>Tracking Range (Passive):<3> One of the factors in
      determining the range of a ranger's Tracking class feature is the
      Wilderness Lore skill; see the description of the ranger class for
      more information on this ability.\n
      __<15>* <11>Harvesting Mushrooms/Herbs (Passive, <4>Unimplemented<11>):<3> When a 
      character picks herbs from a bush or mushrooms from the floor of
      the dungeon (using the normal 'g'et item command), a Wilderness 
      Lore check is made, though not displayed, usually against DC 15,
      though potent herbs and mushrooms might have a higher DC. If this
      check is failed, the herb or mushroom automatically becomes cursed,
      and will have only deleterious effects if consumed.\n
      __Since this is not a magical curse, but merely the result of a
      bad preparation, it does not show up to most things that normally
      detect curses.";
