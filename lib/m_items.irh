// ww: before, these were spread out so that one was a ring, one was a
// belt, etc. However, there were so few magical items that this meant that
// repeat players always knew just what was happening: when you found a
// magic helmet, it was a helm of sound resistance. Since 3E handles
// stacking bonuses much better than 2E, there's no reason not to allow
// rings and amulets and whatnot to also provide sound resistance. This
// keeps players on their toes, makes inventory shuffling more fun, etc,
// but doesn't really give any more power. 
/* FJM: Unfortunately, there's several reasons that this isn't that good.
   * Firstly, it kills flavour by making items more generic, and goes 
     against the feel of old-school RPGs.
   * Secondly, the item ID system isn't set up to properly handle multiple
     items types unless there's only two and one is a potion.
   * Third, I think that vermislitude would be better served by subtly
     different items rather than the same item in different categories.
   * Forth, given how drastically more common low-level items are in
     Incursion (compared to base d20), I really don't like the "should I
     wear Fire Resistance as a set of bracers, ring, amulet or hat?" factor
     implicit with multi-slot items in late game.
   * Finally, limited items in each category helps players identify them
     -- note how players build cost-categories in NetHack to help ID
     unknown items. The problem of "only one item per category" can be
     solved by limiting some categories of items to appearing only deeper
     in the dungeon -- something always planned but never implemented
     until now.
     IOW, this makes the "identify school" feature of Intuition valuable.

/* NOTE: All wands are not created equal! The level I've assigned
 *   them is based on the level it would be balanced for a PC to
 *   wield them at, rather than their effective power compared to
 *   each other. A level 3 wand is not as powerful as a level 6
 *   wand, but one level 3 wand might be as useful as four other
 *   level 3 wands put together, and thus a much "better" item.
 *   "Suboptimal" is fine for magical items, because A) you might
 *   never find the optimal choice, and B) you don't sacrifice
 *   anything inherent to your character by throwing away a sub-
 *   optimal wand (or any other item).
 * Eventually, once we have a better idea how they influence game-
 *   play, I'll ad EF_GOOD and EF_GREAT to these, so that lucky
 *   characters are more likely to find the good ones at a given
 *   level, and unlucky characters... not.
 * Westley, I'd encourage you to change the Level values for these
 *   if you think it would improve balance, but please don't
 *   simplify or streamline them -- that's counter to the design
 *   principle I want for magical items.
 * I'm evaluating these based on seven factors: Area, Damage, Mana
 *   Cost, Damage Type, Extra Effects, Saving Throw and Other
 * Area:
 *   Poor (-1)    - Bolt
 *   Good (+1)    - Beam
 *   Great (+3)   - Ball/Globe/Chain
 *   Perfect (+4) - Hits everything in area, caster immune
 * Damage:
 *   Poor (-1)  - 1d6/plus or 1d4+1/plus
 *   Average    - 1d8/plus
 *   Good (+1)  - 2d6/plus
 *   Great (+2) - 2d8/plus
 *   Super (+3) - 2d10/plus
 *   Incred. (+4) - 2d12/plus
 * Mana Cost:
 *   Poor (-2)  - 10 mana
 *   Average    - 5 mana
 *   Good (+1)  - 3 mana
 *   Great (+2) - 2 mana
 *   Super (+3) - 1 mana
 * Damage Type:
 *   Base (-2)    - Slashing, Piercing, Blunt
 *   Common (-1)  - Fire
 *   Uncommon     - Cold, Lightning
 *   Rare (+1)    - Acid, Sonic, Poison, Necro
 *   V. Rare (+3) - Pure Magic/unavoidable
 *   (for 2 types, add both mods (min -1))
 * Extra Effects:
 *   Rated by hand at +0 to +4.
 * Limited Targets:
 *   Rated by hand at -1 to -4.
 * Saving Throw:
 *   Negates Utterly (-2)
 *   Reflex for half (no mod)
 *   None (+2)
 * Total
 *   -2 PLUS_1PER1
 *   -1 PLUS_2PER1
 *    0 PLUS_2PER1_ADD1

 * IMPORTANT WAND NOTE:
 *   Until wand balance is more fully tested, I've lowered the item level
 * of all wands by 2 using a kludge in the source code. This is because I
 * want to us constants like PLUS_3PER1 instead of PLUS_1EVERY3, but I also

      power over demons -- but the exact opposite. Demons,

      fire and water.\n
      __The water ring was given to...\n
      __The Ring of Elemental Command (Water) carries several benefits.
      Water elementals cannot attack the wearer unless they succeed at
      a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the wearer's level + the wearer's
      Charisma modifier). All creatures with ties to the elemental plane
      of water (including elementals who make the save) attack the ring
      bearer at a -2 penalty. The wearer gains the ability to command water
      creatures as a Water priest of 12th level, or augments their existing
      ability by +6 -- whichever is superior. The ring also grants its
      wearer the ability to breath water.\n

      the benefits, however -- suffering a -4 penalty to saving throws
      against poison.\n

      <9>wall of ice<7>, <9>ice storm<7>, <9>create water<7> and

/* This is really important to the balance of the Pick Pockets
   skill. We want player characters to be able to get items from
   NPCs in a variety of ways other than just murder, and we want
   murder to be sub-optimal (even ignoring alignment). This gets
   around the typical roguelike problem of inexplicably invincible
   shop-keepers, and makes Pick Pockets a truly valuable skill as
   a source of items PC's without it simply can't get. That's the
   desired behaviour. For the record, these are the obvious ways
   to get items from NPCs:
     * murder and loot -- the ring prevents this
     * paralyze and loot -- how to handle this? ring for now.
     * barter to buy -- this works, but costs gold. NPCs that don't
         want to barter can be made to barter with a really good
         Diplomacy check or a /charm person/ spell, but NPCs won't
         give away items for free when CHARMED. 
     * /dominate person/ -- high enough level to make it inaccessable
         in the early-to-mid game, and it can be made more difficult
         by giving truly powerful or wealthy shop-keepers a Ring of
         Mind Shielding. Even that can be overcome, but it makes sense
         that twinked-out Enchanters should be really good at theft,
         so this is a feature, not a bug.
   
   The "ideal" merchant's kit is something like this:
     * Ring of Item Preservation
     * Ring of Mind Shielding
     * something giving Free Action, bonus versus paralysis
     * offensive wand of weapon of some kind
     * something to boost Spot, but *not* so high that a skilled
         Rogue of a balanced level doesn't have a chance. 

   As always, Bluff can be used to cancel hostility after a failed pick
     pockets attempt, but the DC goes up drastically (+10) the second,
     third, etc. time.

   Stores in towns and cities open into seperate maps that contain a
     merchant NPC; the PC talks to him and the barter screen comes up,
     or he can try to Pick Pockets.

      Revered as holy by the priesthood of Immotian, scholars
      believe they have an older, and more primal, origin than
      the clergy of purity. In fact, many obscure sources link
      them to the efreeti, and some sages claim that a flame
      tongue sword is forged when such a genie slays another
      living creature in the throes of inhuman rage and bathes
      the blade in their blood. The truth remains unknown --
      and the church of Immotian strives to keep it that way.\n
      __Regardless, a flame tongue is a <11>+2 flaming burst
      long sword<7> with a number of special qualities. It
      grants its bearer the Endurance feat and sustains their
      Constitution. When it strikes a corporeal undead, that
      creature's dry, withered flesh catches flame and continues
      to burn, causing it to suffer 3d6 fire damage the first
      turn after the hit, 2d6 the second turn and 1d6 on the
      third. (It is this property, as well as the fire-symbolism,
      that makes the swords so reverred by Immotian). But the
      most famous power the sword has is its <9>tongue of flame<7>
      ability, which can be called upon 3 times a day by activating
      the weapon.\n
      __If a flame tongue sword is ever immersed in water or any
      other flame retardant, the eternal fire that burns on its
      blade it put out, and the sword becomes temporarily inert.
      It can regain its magic after a day has passed by striking
      another creature or being activated.\n
      __<9>Tongue of Flame:<7>  When you activate this special 
      ability, the sheath of flames that normally surrounds the 
      sword's blade extends far past its tip and magically takes 
      on a tangible element like the lash of a whip. The tongue of
      flame lashes out from the sword to a maximum range of the 
      bearer's Charisma modifier times ten in feet (minimum 20) to 
      snare a chosen target.\n
      __The swordbearer must make a ranged touch attack
      to hit the intended target. If this is successful,
      the tongue of flame deals 4d8 damage to the
      victim and then, if the victim still lives and is
      a Large or smaller corporeal creature, it and the
      swordbearer make an opposed Strength test.\n
      __If the bearer prevails, his foe is yanked into
      the air, pulled across the map and lands directly
      at his feet (i.e., in melee range), and
      automatically suffers knockdown in the process.

   -- using a staff spell if you don't know the spell costs

   -- EF_NOSWAP causes an item to give you the ATTUNED_SLOT
      stati when you wield it, and if you wield another item
      with EF_NOSWAP, you don't get the benefits until you've
      rested for a full day. ATTUNED_SLOT goes away when you
      rest, provided you aren't still wielding the item.
   -- EF_REST_WIELD delays the effects of wielding until the
      first time you rest, and is the flag that we give to the
      Ring of Invisibility, Ring of Regeneration and Ring of
      Sustenance (as well as perhaps Ring of Hold Life and
      other powerful resist rings, perhaps including the Cowl
      of Warding).
   -- The function getTouchRange() takes into account things
      like TELEKINETIC, natural reach and so forth in order
      to determine the range at which you can grapple, punch,
      kick, open doors, disarm traps, pick up items and so
      forth. TK will take some other adjustments as well, though,
      to account for replacing Str with Wis and Dex with Int,
      so we'll need an e.isTelekinetic flag. /Telekinesis/
      thus duplicates the SRD's /Ranged Legerdemain/ ability.
   -- Different food items decay at different rates, with some
      (smoked meat) lasting nearly forever and others (pile of
      frest fruit) decaying very quickly. Thus, there's a divison
      of three categories in regard to food -- nutrition, weight
      and shelf life.
   -- Downsides for sustenance and regeneration -- perhaps
      sustenance makes you slower (always full) and a little
      less healthy (-2 Con), and regen makes you get hungry much
      more rapidly.
   -- Improved Invisibility can be seen through per the rules in
      the SRD; once you've been spotted, a foe who spots you can
      make a check every time you move to keep their eyes on you,
      and that check isn't TOO hard.
   -- The "diversity clause" in item gen -- if there's less than
      20 different types of items of the selected type available
      at the selected depth, then you have an N in 20 chance of
      going back and selecting a different type of item to gen --
      where N is (20 - possible items)
   -- You need to be proficient with a weapon to be considered to
      be wielding it -- a mage can't pick up a long sword that
      grants fire res and get the benefit unless he spends a feat
      learning to use long swords.
   -- divide MAP.H into two files
   -- When a player has an INNATE_SPELL with the EF_SPECABIL flag,
      it should _not_ show up in Spell Manager, but it _should_
      show up in the 'u'se menu list for special abilities. There
      should also be an option in the EventInfo structure called
      isCustomTimeout that lets an effect set its own timeout.
      Using this, we can implement class features like the Shadow
      Companion of a shadowdancer. The character sheet should also
      be set up to read innate spell special abilities and add them
      to the class ability list.
   -- Perhaps there should be a MSG_ABILITY_NAME to allow cases
      like the Oathbow renaming dwarven focus to be "Elven Oath" or
      something similar. This could also be used for class
      features and prestige classes.
   -- Add a stati TERRAIN_IMMUNITY that prevents terrain effects
      for a specific terrain resource, so that we don't have to
      keep adding special cases to terrain events for boots of
      the winterlands, etc.
